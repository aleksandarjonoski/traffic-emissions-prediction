# Traffic emissions prediction system

This repo is based on the future ideas for the Trafic Density Estimation system based on OpenCV and developed and presented on Vision3.14 Hackaton in Bitola, Macedonia on 7-9 Oct 2022. I think we should not stop there and proceed with playing around and have fun with OpenCV, ML and AI

Different projects are placed in separate dir's in this repo, please follow the instructions inside to run and test.
